1. How do you know where to start?

You are working from text files, that is all you are creating
you start by making a text file that a browser recognizes.
appended by .html   This answer only applies to Web dev.
If you started with android app development then you will
need more and a google search would probably be the best answer.

went to here after searching -> android app development how to start
https://developer.android.com/about/start.html

If you require more direction there are things like pluralsight.

but it does cost money

2. What is the best way to debug?

By starting with the output of you error and by having a tremendous amount of patience.  Each bug exists as series of small errors that have built up to a larger error so the process is one of seeking the source.  Any language will have an equivalent console.log, print, std_out.  This is your computer talking to you, in the browser you will get output in the console like this `some error happened    javscriptFile.js  line 33`  That's where you start...
