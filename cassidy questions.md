Still don't know know what DOM is, do you?

Does anyone really?  I do know what it stands for:

-  Document -> a representative state
-  Object   -> that acts as an object, think: JS object, JSON object
-  Model    -> that models the rendered html in the client

found after searching -> DOM

[w3Schools DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)

can you read this?

yes

My image is not showing up on my Simple-HTML-Site after making a server.js. Copied full path AND moved to public folder. What gives?
